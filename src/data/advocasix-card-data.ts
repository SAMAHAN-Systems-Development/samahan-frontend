    content: `As the remaining time we have to fight against climate change quickly decreases, 
      there is an increasing necessity for all sectors to unite toward climate action. 
      While governments and businesses are making progress in shifting towards more sustainable practices, 
      various members are still prioritizing profit over the planet. Along with that, 
      groups of skeptics still question the science of climate change. Led by the Ecoteneo Student Unit, 
      the SAMAHAN shall take a more proactive stance as it promotes climate education, sustainable lifestyle, 
      and sustainable development. Inspired by fellow advocates around the world, 
      it shall continue to serve as a model student government that champions the care of our common home.`,

    content: `In a time where the Philippines grapples with persistent issues of corruption, disinformation, 
      red-tagging, political dynasties, and attacks on civic spaces, the call for good governance has never 
      been more urgent. The SAMAHAN envisions a future where leadership is defined by integrity, competence, 
      and a genuine commitment to the public good — where leaders and citizens work together for a just, peaceful, 
      and inclusive Philippines, mindful of the voices of the marginalized, the underrepresented, and the rural poor. 
      Beyond the upcoming 2025 Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) Elections, the SAMAHAN remains steadfast in 
      championing democratic values and progressive, youth-led leadership. Through platforms for political education, 
      issue-based conversations, and electoral participation, we aim to empower students and communities to demand 
      accountability, reject violence and impunity, and push for leaders who embody our collective hopes 
      for good governance, peace, and social justice.`,

    on young people, SAMAHAN upholds holistic health as central to student formation. Rooted in Ignatian values, we champion 
    initiatives that nurture not just physical and mental well-being, but also emotional, spiritual, and sexual wellness. 
    More than simply restoring campus vibrance post-pandemic, we commit to creating safe, inclusive, and empowering spaces 
    where Ateneans can pause, heal, and thrive — cultivating resilience, joy, and balance as we navigate life within and beyond the university.`,

    Filipinos of their right to meaningful learning, the fight for quality education remains urgent. SAMAHAN stands committed to addressing 
    these systemic challenges through advocacy, storytelling, and community partnerships — championing education as a public good and a tool 
    for social justice. Beyond classrooms and curricula, we work to dismantle economic, social, and political barriers, ensuring that every learner, 
    regardless of income, gender, or location, can access safe, inclusive, and empowering spaces to shape a better, more equitable society.`,

    take a proactive stance in initiating discourses on Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Expression [SOGIE] and calling for the hopeful approval 
    of the SOGIE or Anti-Discrimination Bill [ADB]. Now more than ever is the time to maneuver a long-term proposition for a SOGIE-specific gender 
    sensitivity education and information dissemination. We aim to cultivate an environment that recognizes LGBTQ+ people as equals and ensures that 
    their rights are protected in the same way that everyone else is, notwithstanding their sexual orientation.`,
